<h2>Quiz 3</h2>

The data for the final Harvey project is not available to me as of April 23rd, 2018. Instead, I have chosen to use the Oregon Counties 2015 data. I've taken the county polygon shapefile from the data set and converted it into a .geojson, .simplified geojson, and finally a .topojson file. Below is a table showing the size changes from one file to the next, and after simplification.
